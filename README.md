# Tea Brewery, A Flask Web App

Welcome to **Tea Brewery**, a warm and calming web app built with **Flask** on Python.

The images used for tea were sourced from Pinterest. Parts of the styling were generated by ChatGPT.

## How It Works
The home page (index.html) displays a dropdown menu of teas with cute emojis.
When you click “Brew It 🍵,” your selection is sent to the Flask server through `POST`, and you are redirected to `/brew`.

Flask retrieves a cozy message and image for that tea type. The brew.html page shows your tea and message, along with a “Brew another cup” button, which redirects you make to the home page.


## Modifying
You can easily add more tea options!
Add your new tea image in /static/images/, e.g. green-tea.jpg.
Add the new tea to the dropdown in index.html.

Modify CSS colors in index.html and brew.html for your preferred palette

Add gentle animations or background music for an even cozier vibe

Optional upgrade: add a progress animation or “steam” effect for fun
